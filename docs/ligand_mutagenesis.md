# CASF-2016 ligand-mutagenesis pipeline

Automated implementation of Masters et al. 2025's *ligand-side* adversarial
challenges (Fig. 4 glucose methylation, Fig. 5 ATP charge swap) on the
CASF-2016 protein–ligand complex set. Lives under
[`analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/`](../analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/).

This module is the **ligand-side sibling** of
[`analysis/casf_mutagenesis/`](../analysis/casf_mutagenesis/). The two
modules share data discovery, input renderers, and docking helpers; they
differ in what they perturb (protein pocket vs ligand chemistry) and in
the manifest shape.

## What the paper does, and what the existing repo had

The paper hand-built **12 ligand variants on 2 systems**:

- **Fig. 4 (n=6):** progressive O-methylation of glucose hydroxyls (one
  more methylated OH per rung), tested on GDH (2VWH).
- **Fig. 5 (n=6):** ATP triphosphate replaced by either neutral alkyl
  chains (methyl / ethyl / propyl gem-dimethyl ladder) or quaternary
  ammonium chains (+1 / +2 / +3 formal-charge ladder), tested on CDK2
  (1B38).

The paper did **not** run a CASF-scale ligand sweep analogous to Fig. 3's
pocket sweep. The shipped repo contains only the 12 hand-built SMILES
(see [`analysis/src/config.py::ATP_CHARGE_SMILES`](../analysis/src/config.py)
and `GLUCOSE_SMILES`). This module **encodes the paper's transformation
rules** so they apply systematically to every CASF-2016 ligand carrying
the relevant functional group — extending the paper's two systems × 12
variants to the full dataset.

## Authoritative rules

Paper § "Glucose methylation" and § "ATP charge variants" only describe
the transformations narratively; the algorithmic specification below is
inferred from the literal SMILES they shipped, decoded carefully so the
generator reproduces all 12 hand-built SMILES exactly (canonical-SMILES
equality).

### Hydroxyl methylation (paper Fig. 4)

| variant | rule |
|---|---|
| `wt` | original ligand SMILES (control) |
| `meth_k` (k=1..N) | first **k** aliphatic free hydroxyls methylated (-OH → -OCH₃) |

Eligibility SMARTS: `[OX2H][CX4]` — free hydroxyl on sp3 carbon. Ring
oxygens (no implicit H) and phenolic hydroxyls (sp2 C) are excluded by
construction.

**Order of methylation across the ladder** is chemistry-aware so the
paper's glucose ladder reproduces exactly:

1. **Class priority:** hemiacetal OH → secondary OH → primary OH →
   methanol-like.
2. **Within-class tiebreak:** shortest bond-path distance from the
   hemiacetal C (so secondary OHs are walked around the ring from the
   anomeric C — for glucose: C2, C3, C4 in pyranose order).
3. **Final tiebreak:** RDKit canonical atom rank.

Pure canonical-rank ordering picks the wrong OH first on glucose (it
picks the 6'-CH₂OH before the anomeric OH). The chemistry-aware ordering
+ path-distance tiebreak is required for paper reproduction.

Ladder length is capped at `MAX_METHYLATIONS = 6` to bound combinatorial
blow-up on polyhydroxyl ligands.

### Phosphate / carboxylate charge swap (paper Fig. 5)

Two ladders, both attached at a single anchor:

| variant | replacement attached to bridging-O |
|---|---|
| `chrg_neu_methyl` | `-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃` (7 atoms) |
| `chrg_neu_ethyl`  | `-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH₃` (9 atoms) |
| `chrg_neu_propyl` | `-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH₃` (13 atoms) |
| `chrg_pos_1` | `-CH₂-N⁺(CH₃)₃` (5 atoms, +1 charge) |
| `chrg_pos_2` | `-CH₂-N⁺(CH₃)₂-CH₂-N⁺(CH₃)₃` (9 atoms, +2 charge) |
| `chrg_pos_3` | `-CH₂-N⁺(CH₃)₂-CH₂-N⁺(CH₃)₂-CH₂-N⁺(CH₃)₃` (13 atoms, +3 charge) |

Increment from `chrg_neu_methyl` → `chrg_neu_ethyl` is uneven (+2 atoms,
not +3) because the methyl variant ends in a -CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ propyl tail
while the ethyl/propyl variants end in a -C(CH₃)₂-CH₃ tert-butyl tail.
The replacement SMILES are decoded directly from the paper's
`ATP_CHARGE_SMILES` strings — see code comments in
[`rules/charge_swap.py`](../analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/rules/charge_swap.py).

**Eligibility (priority: phosphate > carboxylate):**

| path | SMARTS | paper-faithful? |
|---|---|---|
| phosphate | `[#6][OX2;!R][P]` (-C-O-P linkage; bridging O kept) | yes (paper Fig. 5 target) |
| carboxylate | `[CX4][CX3](=O)[OX2H,OX1-]` (alpha-C – COOH/COO⁻) | no (soft extension) |

**Algorithm.** Match the SMARTS; cut the bond at the anchor → leaving-group
boundary (O-P bond for phosphate; alpha-C – carboxyl-C bond for
carboxylate). Drop the disconnected leaving-group fragment via
`Chem.GetMolFrags`. Attach the replacement fragment (atom 0 = attachment
point) at the kept anchor via `Chem.CombineMols` + `AddBond`. Atom-index
tracking through `RemoveAtom` calls uses `Atom.SetAtomMapNum(99)` on the
kept anchor before deletion.

**Stereochemistry preservation:** the kept anchor C and the rest of the
sugar are untouched by the rule, so RDKit preserves their `[C@H]`/
`[C@@H]` tags through the round-trip.

### Aromatic halogenation (informational extension — NOT in the paper)

| variant | rule |
|---|---|
| `halo_F_1`, `halo_Cl_1`, `halo_Br_1` | single aromatic-CH → C-X at the lowest-canonical-rank aromatic CH |

Eligibility SMARTS: `[c;H1]`. RDKit handles aromatic-CH → aromatic-CX
natively; no kekulization concern. Single substitution only (no
combinatorial ladder — that's deliberate to bound the manifest size).
Variants are flagged `paper_faithful=False`.

## Variant naming scheme

Names are filename-safe (alphanumeric + underscores). Unlike the
binding-site sibling — which has a fixed `VARIANTS = ("wt","rem","pack",
"inv")` tuple — the variant set here is **dynamic per system** because
the eligible rules depend on the ligand's functional groups. Downstream
model-runner scripts should read variant names from the manifest, not
from a hard-coded tuple.

| pattern | rule | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `wt` | – | unmodified ligand |
| `meth_<k>` | methylation | k aliphatic OHs methylated, k ∈ {1..min(N_OH, 6)} |
| `chrg_neu_{methyl,ethyl,propyl}` | charge_swap | neutral-alkyl ladder |
| `chrg_pos_{1,2,3}` | charge_swap | cationic-ammonium ladder |
| `halo_{F,Cl,Br}_1` | halogenation | single aromatic halogen substitution |

## Data sources

Same as the binding-site sibling — all CASF paths flow through
`casf_mutagenesis.config` (re-exported by `ligand_mutagenesis.config`):

| input | path |
|---|---|
| crystal protein PDB | `data/casf2016/raw/<pdbid>/<pdbid>_protein.pdb` |
| crystal ligand SDF | `data/casf2016/crystal_ligands/<pdbid>_ligand.sdf` |
| HET-code SMILES cache | `data/casf2016/smiles/het_smiles_cache.json` |
| PDBbind metadata | `data/casf2016/labels/PDBbind_data_dict.json` |
| 20-complex smoke test | `data/casf2016/labels/PDBbind_casf2016_subset20.json` |
| full CASF-2016 (285 PDBs) | `data/casf2016/labels/PDBbind_data_split_cleansplit.json["casf2016"]` |

## Per-system pipeline (`build.py::build_system`)

For each PDB id:

1. **Resolve files** — `protein.pdb` and `_ligand.sdf` under `data/casf2016/`.
2. **Get WT SMILES.** Prefer crystal-SDF-derived canonical SMILES
   (`Chem.MolToSmiles(mol_from_sdf)`) over the HET cache — same reasoning
   as the binding-site sibling (kekulization safety).
3. **Extract protein chain sequences** via
   `casf_mutagenesis.sequence.extract_chain_sequences` (gemmi-based).
   Sequences are **constant across all variants** in this module since
   we only perturb the ligand.
4. **Run rules.** For each rule (methylation, charge_swap, halogenation):
   record per-rule eligibility in the manifest. If eligible, generate
   the ladder variants.
5. **Render per-variant inputs:**
   - **AF3:** `casf_mutagenesis.inputs_af3.render_af3` (local "alphafold3"
     dialect, version 2, no-MSA placeholder).
   - **Boltz:** `casf_mutagenesis.inputs_boltz.render_boltz` (YAML,
     `msa: empty`).
   - **Docking:** `receptor.pdb` + `box.json` are constant per system —
     written once for `wt` and **hardlinked or copied** to every other
     variant's `docking/` directory. `ligand.sdf` is freshly
     RDKit-embedded per variant via
     `casf_mutagenesis.inputs_docking._embed_ligand`. Box is centred on
     the WT crystal ligand centroid (25 × 25 × 25 Å, same as
     binding-site sibling).
6. **Write manifest entry** capturing wt SMILES + source, per-rule
   eligibility report, per-variant {rule, smiles, applied changes,
   paper_faithful flag, out_dir}, warnings.

## Verification (gating test)

[`scripts/00_verify_reference_systems.py`](../analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/scripts/00_verify_reference_systems.py)
asserts that the rules reproduce all 11 paper SMILES on the two paper
systems. Without this gate the systematic CASF sweep is meaningless.

| ladder | n | parent SMILES | source in repo |
|---|---|---|---|
| glucose methylation | 5 | `GLUCOSE_SMILES["glucose_0"]` | `analysis/src/config.py:72` |
| ATP charge swap (neutral) | 3 | `ATP_SMILES` | `analysis/src/config.py:52-55` |
| ATP charge swap (cationic) | 3 | `ATP_SMILES` | `analysis/src/config.py:52-55` |

The test canonicalises both the generated and the expected SMILES via
`Chem.MolToSmiles(canonical=True, isomericSmiles=True)` before comparing,
so equivalent SMILES writings (different starting atom, different
canonicalisation seed) compare equal. Stereochemistry is verified by
direct atom-by-atom comparison of the canonical strings.

**Negative-eligibility check** included: glucose has no phosphate or
carboxylate, so `charge_swap.is_eligible` must refuse it.

**Last known good run (2026-05-07):**

```
=== glucose hydroxyl methylation (paper Fig. 4) ===
  ✓ meth_1..5 all match glucose_1..5

=== ATP triphosphate charge swap (paper Fig. 5) ===
  ✓ chrg_neu_{methyl,ethyl,propyl} all match atp_charge_{methyl,ethyl,propyl}
  ✓ chrg_pos_{1,2,3} all match atp_charge_{1,2,3}

=== negative eligibility checks ===
  ✓ charge_swap refuses glucose

=== summary ===
  glucose methylation : PASS
  ATP charge swap     : PASS
  negative eligibility: PASS
```

## Pilot run — subset20 (2026-05-07)

`01_build_subset20.py` on the 20-PDB CASF subset
(`PDBbind_casf2016_subset20.json`).

**Outcome:** 20/20 systems built, 0 errors, 0 warnings, **93 total variants**.

**Per-rule eligibility distribution:**

| rule | n eligible / 20 | systems |
|---|---|---|
| methylation | 5 | 4bkt, 4w9l, 3dx2, 3b5r, 4ivc |
| charge_swap | 2 | 1vso (phosphate), 1z9g (carboxylate) |
| halogenation | 19 | all except 1vso |

Most CASF ligands have at least one aromatic CH (halogenation eligible).
Methylation eligibility is much rarer (5 of 20 have a free aliphatic
hydroxyl). Charge-swap eligibility is rarest (2 of 20: one phosphate,
one carboxylate).

**Cross-module sanity:** `outputs/1pxn/wt/boltz.yaml` ligand SMILES
matches `casf_mutagenesis/outputs/1pxn/wt/boltz.yaml` exactly — both come
from the same `_smiles_from_crystal_sdf` path.

**Per-variant chemistry spot-check (4bkt):** WT ligand SMILES
`CNC(=O)[C@@H]1C[C@@H](O)CN1C(=O)Cc1cc(C)no1` → `meth_1` SMILES
`CNC(=O)[C@@H]1C[C@@H](OC)CN1C(=O)Cc1cc(C)no1` — exactly one extra `-OC`
group, stereochemistry preserved.

**Results path:**

```
analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/outputs/manifest_subset20.json
analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/outputs/<pdbid>/<variant>/{af3.json, boltz.yaml,
                                                       docking/{receptor.pdb,
                                                                ligand.sdf,
                                                                box.json}}
```

Manifest entries record per-variant `{rule, smiles, applied, paper_faithful,
out_dir}` plus a top-level `rules_eligible` dict; downstream model-runner
scripts read the variant set from this manifest (not from a fixed tuple).

## Full CASF-2016 build (2026-05-07, n=285)

`02_build_full_casf.py` on all 285 CASF-2016 PDB ids from
`PDBbind_data_split_cleansplit.json["casf2016"]`.

**Outcome:** 251/285 systems built successfully, **1300 total variants**
emitted. 34 systems failed with `FileNotFoundError: missing
<pdbid>_protein.pdb` — these are CASF-2016 PDB ids for which the protein
crystal isn't present in the local `data/casf2016/raw/` (a data-availability
gap upstream of this module, not a code defect). Failed ids:

```
1a30 1c5z 2p15 2vvn 2wca 2zcr 2zda 2zy1 3acw 3arp 3arq 3aru 3arv 3ary
3b65 3bv9 3dxg 3f3a 3kgp 3myg 3o9i 3prs 3pww 3qqs 3r88 3twp 3uex 3uri
3zsx 4abg 4kzq 4kzu 4owm 4pcs
```

**Per-rule eligibility (of 251 OK systems):**

| rule | n eligible | % |
|---|---|---|
| halogenation | 213 | 85 % |
| methylation | 74 | 29 % |
| charge_swap | 42 | 17 % |

**Variant rule counts (1300 total):**

| rule | variants |
|---|---|
| `wt` | 251 |
| `halo_*` | 639 |
| `chrg_*` | 252 (= 42 × 6) |
| `meth_*` | 158 (mean ≈ 2 OHs per methylation-eligible ligand) |

**Variants-per-system distribution:**

| variants | systems |
|---|---|
| 1 (wt only) | 9 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 4 (wt + halo only) | 140 |
| 5 | 32 |
| 6 | 16 |
| 7 | 16 |
| 8 | 7 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 (wt + halo + charge_swap) | 21 |
| 11–13 | 7 |

The 9 systems with only the `wt` variant have a ligand with no aliphatic
OH, no phosphate, no carboxylate, AND no aromatic CH — usually small
crystallographic ligands like single ions or simple cofactors.

**Results path:**

```
analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/outputs/manifest_full.json     # 285-system manifest
analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/outputs/<pdbid>/<variant>/     # per-variant inputs
```

Downstream model-runner / analysis scripts should:

- Read `manifest_full.json` to enumerate (pdbid, variant) pairs and pick up
  per-variant ligand SMILES and the `paper_faithful` flag (use this to
  filter the soft-extension carboxylate / halogenation variants if you
  want to limit to the paper's exact transformations).
- Skip systems with `status == "error"` (the 34 missing-PDB cases).
- Reuse the protein chain sequences across all variants of a system
  (constant in this module — the docking inputs share `receptor.pdb` and
  `box.json` via hardlink for the same reason).

## Running on a different host (env-var overrides)

This module re-exports all CASF / Boltz / AF3 paths from
`casf_mutagenesis.config`, so the same env-var overrides apply
([`docs/casf_mutagenesis.md` § "Running on a different host"](casf_mutagenesis.md#running-on-a-different-host-env-var-overrides)).

The one module-specific override:

| variable | meaning | lab default |
|---|---|---|
| `CONTRASCF_LIGAND_OUT` | output root for this module | `analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/outputs` |

## Running the pipeline

All commands assume `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` points at `rdkit_env`'s `lib/`
(set automatically by `env/lab.sh` / `env/carc.sh`).

```bash
LIB="/home/aoxu/miniconda3/envs/rdkit_env/lib"
PY="/home/aoxu/miniconda3/envs/rdkit_env/bin/python"

# 1. Gating test — must pass before doing anything else
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIB:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH $PY \
  analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/scripts/00_verify_reference_systems.py

# 2. Build inputs for the 20-system subset
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIB:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH $PY \
  analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/scripts/01_build_subset20.py

# 3. Build inputs for the full CASF-2016 (285 systems).
#    Supports --start / --limit / --manifest for chunked re-runs.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIB:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH $PY \
  analysis/ligand_mutagenesis/scripts/02_build_full_casf.py
```

## Implementation gotchas (and workarounds)

| issue | resolution |
|---|---|
| Paper's `glucose_0` SMILES is a different canonical writing of the same α-D-glucopyranose as `GLC_SMILES` | verify always compares canonicalised SMILES; never compare raw strings |
| Pure canonical-rank ordering picks 6'-CH₂OH before anomeric OH on glucose | chemistry-aware priority class (hemiacetal → secondary → primary) + path-distance tiebreak required for paper reproduction |
| `Chem.GetShortestPath(mol, a, a)` errors with "Invariant Violation aid1 != aid2" | guard `c_idx != hemi_c_idx` before calling |
| Atom indices shift after `RWMol.RemoveAtom` | tag the anchor with `SetAtomMapNum(99)` before deletion, then look up by map number |
| Charge-swap chain-length off-by-one easy to make | replacement SMILES decoded by hand from `analysis/src/config.py::ATP_CHARGE_SMILES`; covered by 6/6 gating-test assertions |
| RDKit "molecule is tagged as 2D" warning when reading crystal SDFs | benign — emitted by most PDBbind crystal SDFs; ignore |

## Out of scope (deferred to follow-ons)

- **Running the models** (AF3 / Boltz-2 / docking) on the generated
  inputs. Mirrors `casf_mutagenesis/scripts/03_*` and `04_*`. Variant
  names in the manifest are filename-safe so the wrappers can be written
  by reading variant names from the manifest (not from a fixed tuple).
- **MSA injection** for the AF3 inputs. Protein sequences are constant
  per system in this module, so one MSA per system can be reused across
  all variants of that system. Reuse `casf_mutagenesis.msa_via_boltz`
  (Boltz piggyback) and `inputs_af3.clean_a3m_for_af3`.
- **Per-variant ligand-RMSD scoring.** The binding-site sibling's
  `casf_mutagenesis.analysis.superpose_by_index` will work directly
  (protein numbering is identical across variants since protein is
  constant), but per-rule common-substructure SMARTS — analogous to
  `analysis/src/config.py::COMMON_SUBSETS["ADENOSINE"]` and
  `["GLC_CORE"]` — are needed to pair "the same atoms" across a WT
  ligand and its variants for RMSD purposes. Design that in a follow-on.
- **More chemistry rules.** Deisostere swap (C=O → C=S, etc.) and
  combinatorial halogenation are candidate extensions; current scope is
  the paper's two rules + single-position halogenation only.
